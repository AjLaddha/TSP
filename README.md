# TSP
In this project we had designed the best tour visiting all cities with minimum cost of time. The input is given as a
file with euclidean distances and non euclidean distances for n cities in a file. The number of cities(n) is 100 , 250 ,500 for both euclidean and non-euclidean cities. 
We have to find minimum cost and minimum cost route in time limit of running code is 300 seconds.
Also at later stage we had run it for 5000 cities and find out minimum cost and minimum cost route.
